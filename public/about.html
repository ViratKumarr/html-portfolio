<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My self <b><em>Virat</em></b> and I'm a 'Computer Science' student persuing my BTECH from 'Cambridge Institute' , Bangalore, India.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Currently I'm studying programming languages like <b>C,Java,Html,Css,Javascript</b> and giving my all to understand today's technical world surrounded by Internet.
</p>
<p>I'm sure by the end of the year 2023 I'll become a fullstack developer using above programming languages as i mentioned
if I constantly push my boundaries and trying to catch-up with my better-half.<br> She's my <b>biggest inspiration</b> and <b>motivation</b> and for her sake I'll push my extent to whatever it takes.
